## Collect 5'UTR sequences from Ensembl using BioMart
5utrSeqCollector is an R script that searches through the 69 species in the ensembl database for all available 5'UTR sequences with a 5000bp long upstream region. It records each 5'UTR sequence and a random sequence from the upstream region of equal length to the 5'UTR sequence.
